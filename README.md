# odin-testing-practice
The Odin Project: Testing Practice

# Description

This excercise demonstrates my ability to work with the Jest testing library. The goal here was to use TDD (Test Driven Development) to create functionality via a red/green strategy where we start with writing our test case(s) and proceed to incrementally refactor our code to pass our defined test(s).

# Goals

Write tests for the following, and then make the tests pass!

1.) A capitalize function that takes a string and returns it with the first character capitalized.

2.) A reverseString function that takes a string and returns it reversed.

3.) A calculator object that contains functions for the basic operations: add, subtract, divide, and multiply. Each of these functions should take two numbers and return the correct calculation.

4.) A caesarCipher function that takes a string and a shift factor and returns it with each character “shifted”.

5.) An analyzeArray function that takes an array of numbers and returns an object with the following properties: average, min, max, and length.

# Takeaways

I have found the beauty of thinking stratigically about our code when writing out tests first before getting into the thick of the problem. I felt that despite taking time to write test cases, I was more proficient when working through the problem. Going in with a clearer view of expectations made me feel more agile and efficient. Immediate validation can be recieved by testing edge cases or using new tests for additonal functionality.
